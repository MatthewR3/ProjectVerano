# Project Verano

This is a personal project between some college students over the summer of 2016. Feel free to look around, though there may not be much to see. Contact matthewrastovac@gmail.com if you have any questions or requests. This code is purposely simplified in many places, and it's not guaranteed to be optimal or efficient.

# Accessing the Demo

1. Install flask ("pip install flask" in cmd)
2. Run server.py
3. Go to 127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser

Note that the demo only uses the start and end date values as parameters. The train date and algorithms don't change anything. When we complete an estimation algorithm, I will hook it up and it will display with the other selected algorithms.
